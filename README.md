## changed

I did some changes in footer, now the footer is more cleaner and easier to understand the brand. some brand in footer don't have any link to redirect yet.
the other class i didn't changed nothing yet, i tried to simplied the code, but no sucess.

The button of my nav-link (habilidade) and (skills) was no working correctly, that's why skills and habilidade  had the same class name, know i changed the HTML/CSS/JS
now is working appropriately.
